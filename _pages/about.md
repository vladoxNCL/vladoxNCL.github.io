I am a Mexican PhD student at Newcastle University. My research topic is algorithmic fairness, under the supervision of [Paolo Missier](https://sites.google.com/site/paolomissier/) and [Dennis Prangle](https://dennisprangle.github.io/).

My qualifications are a Bachelor's and an MSc in Mathematics from the Mexico National Autonomous University, and an MRes in Cloud Computing from Newcastle University. I am a full-time lecturer at Universidad Panamericana, Mexico, on a break for my PhD studies.

I am a semi-retired igo/weiqi/baduk player. Several times Mexican champion, and Iberoamerican champion in 2010. I have a 5 dan diploma by the Taiwan Weiqi Association. I still play casually, mostly on Thursdays at the Newcastle Go Club virtual meetings in PandaNet, where my nickname is *vladox*.

I am a founding member of *Momentum Games*, a video-game-centric company interested in bringing to life challenging, non-traditional games with a positive message. My first (and so far only) game, *Baby Bee*, may be downloaded [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1014660/Baby_Bee/). I came up with the game mechanics, designed the game puzzles and did a significant bit of the programming for it.

Besides go, my other great passion is Photography. In it, I find a space of contemplation where I can focus on appreciating the beauty of things and overcoming the technical challenges of a picture to the best of my ability. As you may already have seen, most of this blog will be photo-centric, both in posting my images and eventually in writing up some stuff about techniques, philosophy and whatever I think may be an interesting read. I try to do all sorts of photography, yet I find that nowadays most of my pics are either landscapes/cityscapes or field macro shots. I like doing street photo as well, in a non-confrotational style, trying to preserve the anonymity of people and focusing on the composition. In that regard, the masters I admire the most are [Fan Ho](https://fanho-forgetmenot.com/) and [Henri Cartier-Bresson](https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/henri-cartier-bresson/).
